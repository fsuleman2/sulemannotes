**Difference b/w web application(me and amazon) and web services(amazon and payment/reebok):

According to W3C: Web Services are the system of software that allows different machines to interact with each other through a network.
Web services can be achieve with the help of XML, SOAP and REST.
XML : Extensible markup language which is used to share data on web in an universal format.

SOAP: It stands for Simple Object Access Protocol which is an application communication protocol that sends and receives messages through XML format. It is one of the best ways to communicate between application over HTTP which is supported by all the browsers and servers.

SOAP is a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main idea behind designing SOAP was to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.

REST was designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular hardware device. 

Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. 

A Restful service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

Web Application : An application that the users access over the internet is called a web application. Generally, any software that is accessed through a client web browser could be called a web application.

-> Web Services can be used to transfer data b/w Web Applications.

-> Web Services can be accessed from any language or platform.

-> A Web Application is meant for humans to read, while Web service is meant for computers to read.

-> A Web app is a complete application with a GUI, however, web services do not have UI.


Q)When to use SOAP and REST?

-> Use SOAP: If there is a requirement that the client needs a guaranteed level of reliability and security

-> Use SOAP:If both the client and server have an agreement on the exchange format then SOAP.
	ex:An example is an online purchasing site in which users add items to a cart before the payment is made.

-> Use SOAP:If the application has a requirement that state needs to be maintained from one request to another
ex:An example is an online purchasing site in which users add items to a cart before the payment is made.


-> Use REST:Since SOAP messages are heavier in content and consume a far greater bandwidth, REST should be used in instances where network bandwidth is a constraint.

-> Use REST:If there is no need to maintain a state of information from one request to another then REST should be used

-> Use REST: Caching – If there is a need to cache a lot of requests then REST is the perfect solution. At times, clients could request for the same resource multiple times. This can increase the number of requests which are sent to the server. By implementing a cache, the most frequent queries results can be stored in an intermediate location. So whenever the client requests for a resource, it will first check the cache. If the resources exist then, it will not proceed to the server. So caching can help in minimizing the amount of trips which are made to the web server.



->Use REST: If you want quick solution and time is your constraint.Coding REST Services and subsequent implementation is far easier than SOAP. So if a quick win solution is required for web services, then REST is the way to go.

-> A Web Worker is a Javascript running in background, without affecting the performance of the page.

-> When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.

-> A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

============================================

A Map is an Associative array data structure that accepts input in the form of key value pair.

Map is an interface we cannot create object of it
so we have to search for the class that implements Map.
1)  HashMap //speed singlle thread
2) HashTable //synch
3) TreeHashMap //sorted
4) LinkedHashMap //insertion order

-> Map has KeySet() that will get all keys
Set<String> keys = map.keySet();
for(String i : Keys){ //iterating the set
	syso(map.get(i)); //getting all the values by passing key.

*Map.Entry
-> Entry Interface inside map interface
Set<Map.Entry<String,String>> values = map.entrySet(); //give key value pair
for(Map.Entry<String,String> e : values){
	syso(e.getKey() + " : " + e.getValue());
}
->If you want speed and can manage with single thread then go for hashmap
-> if speed is not criteria and want synchronization(thread safe) then go for hashtable

-> in hashmap and hashtable insertion order is not maintained so just in case if you want proper insertion order then go for LinkedHashMap.

-> If you want all the elements in map to be in sorted order then go for TreeHashMap.


Hashmap is known as hashmap because it is based on one technique called hashing.

Hashing: It is a process of converting String of characters(Text) in to a short fixed-length value that represents original string. 
Why we are doing this?
Becoz A Shorter value helps in faster indexing and faster searches(lookups).

A SQL index is used to retrieve data from a database very fast. Indexing a table or view is, without a doubt, one of the best ways to improve the performance of queries and applications. A SQL index is a quick lookup table for finding records users need to search frequently.

In java Every Object has a method public int hashcode() that will return a hash value for a given object.

-> if two objects are equal then it suppose to be both has same hashcode.
-> Hashcode is used in storing values into the hashmap

-> hashmap comprises of table of length 16 initially by default
-> each index of table is called an bucket
each bucket consist of key, value and node(linked list)
put("King",100);
put(K k, V v)
hash(k) -> 2306996 we cannot have array of such big number so
we do modulo operation
index = hash(k)%(n-1) here n= hashmap default index 16
index = 2306996%16
index = 4 so this key value will be stored at index 4 as a node
each index is consider as a node(linkedlist) having a refer to next. 
ex: KING|2306996|NULL
right now ptr is not pointing to anywhere
suppose we got one more entry on index 4 we get collisssion so in that case we add that new element after the existing one and make the null to point to that new entry.

ex: KING|2306996|->BLAKE|6677889|NULL

Note: 
1) Collisions occurs only when there is same hashcode generated and element want to store at the same index, those entries will be stored as a linkedlist approach.

2) As you know hashmap is also accept one null key value so index of that would be 0 always,as hash of null is zero 0.


map.get(key)

here the process is same, like we generate hash code and get index.
so the end we get one hashcode and index value
ex: hashcode=64205538 and index = 2
so for fetching the value we see wheather there is a match of Key and hashcode on the particular index, if yes we get the value. else we see is there any reference it is pointing if yes we look for that if there is match we print it else nothing.



In java 8, when we have to many unequal keys which gives same hashcode(index)- when the number of items in a hash bucket grows beyond certain threshold(TREEIFY_THRESHOLD=8), content of that bucket switches from using a linked list of Entry objects to a balanced tree. This theoretically improves the worst-case performance from O(n) to O(log n).
-> performance increases.
In Balanced Search, where left nodes have lesser weight(HashCode or Comparable result) for the Keys involded

9 17 23 50 76 54 (In order)

hashcode collisions: when two unequal objects creating same hashcode.
hashcode collision are managed in hashmap by using the linked list or the balanced tree in java 8

ArrayList internally uses Dynamic arrays
LinkedList internally uses Doubly linked list

Joins used when we want to get result where with the help of one table we couldn't get the result so in that case we used joins.
1st condition : there should be one common column/attribute b/w 2 tables to do join operation.

Joins in SQL are commands which are used to combine rows from two or more tables. based on a relatedcolumn between those fields. They are predominantly used when a user is trying to extract data from tables which have one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many relationship between them.

Types of joins in SQL.
1)Inner join 
2)left join 
3)right join
4)full join

1)Inner join: This type of join returns those records which have matching values in both table. So, if you perform an INNER join operation b/w employee table and the projects table. all the tuples which have matching values in both the tables will be given as output

Syntax:
SELECT Table1.column1,Table1.column2,Table2.column1...
from Table1
INNER JOIN Table2
ON Table1.matchingcolumnName = Table2.MatchingColumnName;

Select Employee.empid,Employee.empname,Project.pid,Project.pname
from Employee
INNER JOIN Project
ON Employee.empid = Project.empid;

2)Left JOIN/Left outer join
The Left join or left outer join returns all the records from the left table and also those records which satisfy a condtion from the right table. Also for the records having no matching values in the right table. the output or the result set will contain the null values.

Syntax:
SELECT Table1.column1,Table1.column2,Table2.column1...
from Table1
LEFT JOIN Table2
ON Table1.matchingcolumnName = Table2.MatchingColumnName;

3) Right join 

4)Full JOIN
Full join or the full outer join retuns all those records which either have a matching in the left table or the right table.
