Q1)Is it possible to change the port of the embedded Tomcat Server in Spring boot?
Ans: Yes, by using the server.port = 9090 in the application.properties. (key value pair)

Q2) Can we Override or replace the embedded tomcat server in Spring boot?
Ans: Yes, we can replace the Embedded Tomcat server with any server by using the Starter dependency in the pom.xml file.

we can use <exclusions><exclusion>the dependency you want to exclude</exclusion></excluions>
<dependency>add the new dependecy where</dependency>
every dependency must contain two tags <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>Spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>


Q3) What is auto-configuration in spring boot? how does it help? why spring boot is called opinionated?
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

Opinionated is a software design pattern that decides or guides you into their way of doing things. Spring Boot is opinionated because it follows the opinionated default configuration that reduces developer efforts to configure the application.

Q4)what is @SpringBootapplication and @EnableAutoConfiguration annotaion?

Ans: @EnableAutoConfiguration is used to enable auto-configuration but @SpringBootapplication does a lot more than that.

It combines @Configuration and @ComponentScan annotations to enable java-based configurtion and component scanning in your project.

@SpringBootApplication = @Configuration + @EnableautoConfiguration + @ComponentScan

@configuration attach on the class and act as a source of bean definations for the application context.

@EnabelAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring boot to start adding beans based on class path settings and on various class path settings. for example if the spring-webmvc is the class path, this annotaion flags the application as a web application and activates the key behaviours such  as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

@ComponentScan(basepackge={"mypack"},{""}) : Tells the Spring where to look for the components, configurations and Services in the application and also letting it find the controllers.


the main() method uses Spring Boot's SpringApplication.run() method to run the application.

commandline interface is an Functional Interface and contain run() that allows us to run anything code on project startup 

Q5) How to disable a specific auto-configuration class?
Ans: we can do it by using exclude attribute of @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation to exclude specific class.

for exmple:
@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={path of className})


6Q)Difference between @Restcontroller and @controller in Spring boot?
@Controller : It maps the pojo object to view or template and makes it human redable.
@RestController simply returns the object and object data is directly written in HTTP Response as JSON or XML.

@RestController = @Controller + @Responsebody

7Q)Describe the flow of HTTPS Request through the spring boot applcation?

8Q)Difference b/w @RequestMapping and @GetMapping?
@RequestMapping can be used with GET,POST,PUT, and many other request methods using method attribute on the annotation.

Whereas @GetMapping is only an extension of @RequestMapping with GET method which helps you to improve clarity on request.

@RequestMapping(value = "/user/{userid}", method = RequestMethod.GET)

@GetMapping(value="/user/user{userId}")


9Q) What is the difference between an embedded container and a WAR?
Ans: The main difference between an embedded container and a WAR file is that you can run Spring Boot App as a JAR from the command prompt without setting up a web server.

But to run a WAR File, you need to first set up a web server like Tomcat which has Servlet container and then you need to deploy WAR there.


When to use WAR: Whenever you want to run you app on server of your choice u want generate WAR File.

When to use JAR: Whenever you want to run your app on an embedded server such as tomcat in spring boot u can generate war so auto it will run on tomcat.

Q10) What is the use of Profiles in spring boot?
Ans: Profiles are a core feature of the framework — allowing us to map our beans to different profiles — for example, dev, test, and prod.

We can then activate different profiles in different environments to bootstrap only the beans we need.

 Use @Profile on a Bean

We use the @Profile annotation — we are mapping the bean to that particular profile; the annotation simply takes the names of one (or multiple) profiles.

Consider a basic scenario: We have a bean that should only be active during development but not deployed in production.

We annotate that bean with a dev profile, and it will only be present in the container during development. In production, the dev simply won't be active:
@Component
@Profile("dev")
public class DevDatasourceConfig

As a quick sidenote, profile names can also be prefixed with a NOT operator, e.g., !dev, to exclude them from a profile.

The next step is to activate and set the profiles so that the respective beans are registered in the container. it can be done in 3 ways i)xml ii)annotation based and iii)java configuration base.

Example: Annotation base

@Autowired
private ConfigurableEnvironment env;
...
env.setActiveProfiles("someProfile");


11Q)What is Spring Actuator? what are its Advantage?
Provides special feature to monitor and manage your application when you push it to production.

example: 
it could be helpfull in checking health of your application.
->info on how many are registered
> info on mapping and end points
-> shutdown your application etc
with the help of actuator you will be provided with end points by using end points you can monitor and manage your application
-> it can be enable by adding actuator dependency.

if end points are publicly available then anybody can shutdown you application.. so to protect that we can take help of spring security and secure actuator endpoints by making it secure so that only a designated person can manage those endpoints rather than the public user.

Q12) how to get all the list of all the beans in your spring boot application?
ans: 
localhost:8080
/actuator/beans
/actuator/health.
/actuator/shutdown
----------------------------------------------
@value used for fetch the  value from properties file like @Value("${property.name}"),  @resource= @Autowired+@Qualifier
---------------------------------------------------------
@Controller -presentation layer
@Service - Service Layer
@Repository - DAO Layer
--------------------------------------------------
Let consider a Scenario where you want to create two objects of same class. and that you want to autowired in another class..
in other class IOC will get confused which object i should autowired in that case what we can use @Qualifer("beanId") just after @Autowired and in configuration file give bean id like this @Bean("beanId") and @Lazy before that.
so whatever object we want we can autowired with the bean id and qualifer and by using @Lazy only the calling object will get invoke.

-------------------------------------
@ResponseBody : if using with @GetMapping then it will convert java object to JSON and Return on Web page.
->It basically serialize the data and send it to json format

Jab Frontend se kuch data ara jaise k form data ara
@RequestMapping(value="/home", method=RequestMethod.GET)
@ResponseBody
public Student home(@RequestBody Student s1){}
Jo bhi data frontend se ara hoga in the form of JSON that will be auto converted into java or deserilize and stored it into s1 object.

@PathVariable : if user is sending any URI Data thru URL that u want to catch and bind it to java variable or object u can do it so by using @PathVariable
suppose you want to fetch details of student  for specific id localhost:8080/name/1
@RequestParam to extract query parameters, form parameters, and even files from the request.
sending username and password for login
@RequestParam and @PathVariable can both be used to extract values from the request URI, but they are a bit different.

@RequestParams extract values from the query string, @PathVariables extract values from the URI path:
if you are sending data from your input form data such as email 

add dependency inside pom.xml for validation
add @valid inside method
in MODEL
add this annotation accroding you need
@NotNull
@Min
@Max(250)

What is annotations?
Ans: Annotations in java represents meta data. In other words it provides some additional information to the java compiler.
suppose your name is an annotation and behind it provides your information
Annoation: @Suleman
Additional Information attached to annotation:Inside that it could have your FN,LS, address,age and phno etc.

Ways to create spring boot project
1. Create a maven project and add starter dependency spring web
2. Use spring intilizr
3. Use IDE like STS
4. Spring boot command line interface

-------------------------------------------
Spring will automatically import the beans into the container and inject to dependencies. These annotations are called Stereotype annotations as well.


@Component:It is a generic stereotype annotation used to mark a java class as a bean so that component-scanning mechanism of spring can pick it up and pull it into the application context.

@Controller : If a bean or class which is responsible for handling the request and generating a response that bean or class must be annotated with @Controller.

@Repository
The @Repository annotation marks a class to be used as a for use with storing data within a repository or database. Specifically, the @Repository annotation provides benefits for objects that would otherwise be utilized as a Data Access Object (DAO).

@Service
We mark beans with @Service to indicate that they're holding the business logic. Besides being used in the service layer, there isn't any other special use for this annotation.

@Bean is used to explicitly declare a single bean, rather than letting Spring do it automatically for us.

In conclusion, it's always a good idea to choose the annotation based on their layer conventions.

Another big difference is that @Component is a class level annotation where as @Bean is a method level annotation and ,by default, name of the method serves as the bean name.

==============================================================Spring MVC from LEX
->This DispatcherServlet handles all the request of the application.
->So all the requests to the application has to be forwaded to dispatcherServlet.
->This can be done in web.xml
<servlet>
<servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>*.htm</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
once DispatcherServlet is initilized in web.xml now you have to give config file with naming convention

dispatcher-servlet.xml

<servlet>
<servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

Special beans in webApplicationContext are:
-Controller
-Handler Mapper
-View Resolver

Anyclass with @Controller annotation can act as a controller class.

@RequestMapping annotation maps request to handler methods in the controller

@Controller facilitates auto-detection of controllers which eliminates the need for configuring the controllers in DispatcherServlet's configuration file.

<context:component-scan base-package="specify controller package here"/>
first letter will auto be small letter.

package mypack;

@controller
public class MyController{

@RequestMapping("/hello.htm")
public ModelAndView sayGreeting(){

}
}

dispatcherservlet.xml and web.xml should be in WEB-INF folder

@Component should be used when your class does not fall into either of three categories i.e. Controllers, Services, and DAOs.
By default, the bean names are derived from class names with a lowercase initial character. Therefore, your above defined beans have the names customerController, customerServiceImpl, and customerRepositoryImpl. It is also possible to give a specific name with a value attribute in those annotations as follows:
@Repository(value="customerRepository")

public class CustomerRepositoryImpl  implements CustomerRepository{	
	//rest of the code
}

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.infy.service,com.infy.repository")
public class SpringConfiguration {
}


application.properties
message = Welcome to Spring

@AutoWired
Enivronment env;

env.getProperty("message")

Q:how to load other properties file data?

for exmple: InfyTelMessage.properties is a file and you want to read data from this.

Solution: by using @PropertySource("classpath:InfyTelmessage.properties")

then next step is 
@AutoWired 
Environment env;
env.getProperty("message")


@ComponentScan – This enables the Spring bean dependency injection feature by using @Autowired annotation. All application components which are annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller are automatically registered as Spring Beans. These beans can be injected by using @Autowired annotation.


The class that is annotated with @SpringBootApplication will be considered as the main class, is also a bootstrap class. It kicks starts the application by invoking the SpringApplication.run() method.  You need to pass the .class file name of your main class to the run() method.


Other than the main class package if any other classes in other packages are essential to be scanned then the package name should be specified using the scanBasePackages attribute.


@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = "com.infosys.irs")


//setter base autowiring
package com.infy.service;
public class CustomerServiceImpl implements CustomerService {
	
	private CustomerRepository customerRepository;
	@Autowired
	public void setCustomerRepository(CustomerRepository customerRepository) {
		this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
	}
      --------
}


//constr based autowiring

package com.infy.service;
public class CustomerServiceImpl implements CustomerService {
		
	private CustomerRepository customerRepository;
	@Autowired
	public CustomerServiceImpl(CustomerRepository customerRepository) {
		this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
	}
     --------------
}

If the container does not find a bean for autowiring, it will throw the NoSuchBeanDefinitionException exception.

If more than one beans of the same type are available in the container, then the framework throws an exception indicating that more than one bean is available for autowiring. To handle this @Qualifier annotation is used as follows: 

package com.infy.service;
public class CustomerServiceImpl {
	@Autowired
        @Qualifier("custRepo")
	private CustomerRepository customerRepository;
         ------------
}

In Spring @Value annotation is used to insert values into variables and method arguments. Using @Value we can either read spring environment variables or system variables. 

We can assign a default value to a class property with @Value annotation:

public class CustomerDTO {
	@Value("1234567891")
	long phoneNo;
	@Value("Jack")
	String name;
	@Value("Jack@xyz.com")
	String email;
	@Value("ANZ")
	String address;
}

Note that it accepts only a String argument but the passed-in value gets converted to an appropriate type during value-injection.

To read a Spring environment variable we can use @Value annotation:

public class CustomerDTO {
	@Value("${value.phone}")
	long phoneNo;
	@Value("${value.name}")
	String name;
	@Value("${value.email}")
	String email;
	@Value("${value.address}")
	String address;
}


The bean scope can be defined for a bean using @Scope annotation in Java class. By default, the scope of a bean is the singleton

@Service("customerService")
@Scope("singleton")
public class CustomerServiceImpl implements CustomerService {

For the "prototype" bean, there will be a new bean created for every request from the application.

@Service("customerService")
@Scope("prototype")
public class CustomerServiceImpl implements CustomerService {

private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomerServiceImpl.class);

logger.warn()
logger.info,error,debug,trace,fatal



-----------------------------Spring AOP
-> Aspect is a class that implements cross-cutting concerns. To declare a class as an Aspect it should be annotated with @Aspect annotation. It should be applied to the class which is annotated with @Component annotation or with derivatives of it.

->Joinpoint is the specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values, etc. In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method.

->Advice is a method of the aspect class that provides the implementation for the cross-cutting concern. It gets executed at the selected join point(s). 


The following table shows the different types of advice along with the execution point they have.

Before: Before advice is executed before the Joinpoint execution.

After: After advice will be executed after the execution of Joinpoint whether it returns with or without exception. Similar to finally block in exception handling.

AfterReturning:AfterReturning advice is executed after a Joinpoint executes and returns successfully without exceptions.

AfterThrowing: AfterThrowing advice is executed only when a Joinpoint exits by throwing an exception.

Around: Around advice is executed around the Joinpoints which means Around advice has some logic which gets executed before Joinpoint invocation and some logic which gets executed after the Joinpoint returns successfully.

->Pointcut represents an expression that evaluates the method name before or after which the advice needs to be executed.

->The business methods of the program before or after which the advice can be called is known as a Joinpoint.

->The advice does not get inserted at every Joinpoint in the program.

->An Advice gets applied only to the Joinpoints that satisfy the Pointcut defined for the advice.

->Pointcut represents an expression that evaluates the business method name before or after which the advice needs to be called.

execution(<modifiers> <return-type> <fully qualified class name>.<method-name>(parameters))

ex:
@Before("execution(* com.infosys.service.CustomerServiceImpl.create(..))")

'*' refers to any return type
(..) refers to 0 or more args



To use Spring AOP and AspectJ in the Spring Boot project you have to add the spring-boot-starter-aop starter in the pom.xml file as follows:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>
