JS NOTES:
let is scope limited where as var is global
let see a case where you build a large project all you have used is var for variable declaration 
so some other person change var name = "suleman" to name = "xyz" it will change throught without giving u an error, 
which is not right. so to overcome that JS comes with let keyword so the other day if you try to change any variable name
and that variable is delcared with 'let' keyword then it will give you an error.

in case of 'const' keyword, you already knew that the value that is delcared with const keyword that can't be overriden 
but in some cases like 
const s=[1,2,3]
let v=s; // definitly it will show an error
but but if you do s[0]=74 then it will not give you an erorr.... so you are just mutating the values, that not suppose to happen
in the case of variable which is delcared with const.

so,so to overcome this problem in ES6, Javascript provides a function called Object.freez to prevent this data mutation.
 
Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 

==================================================================
undefined is just a placeholder where variable exist in the program and value is yet to assigned before execution.
not defined is something that variable does exist anywhere in the program and no value assigned to it.


undefined is a special keyword in JavaScript and `undefined !== not defined`. JS is a loosely typed language (weakly typed language). This video covers an in-depth analysis of the undefined keyword and mistakes you should avoid while using this keyword. It is a special keyword in JS and it acts as a placeholder for variables until they are assigned any value in them.

Understand the difference between undefined and not defined in JS. Many developers assume that undefined is exactly the same as not defined, but that's not true. undefined is a value in JavaScript and in fact, it also takes up memory space.
